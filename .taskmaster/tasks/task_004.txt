# Description: Implement a basic styling system using Tailwind CSS with responsive design principles.
# Details:
Install and configure Tailwind CSS 3.3.2. Set up a base layout component with responsive breakpoints. Create utility classes for typography, spacing, and colors. Implement a simple grid system for responsive layouts. Use Tailwind's built-in dark mode utility for future dark mode support.

# Test Strategy:
Create visual regression tests using Jest-image-snapshot. Test responsive behavior across different viewport sizes. Ensure consistent styling across different browsers.
