# Task ID: 15
# Title: Setup CI/CD and Deployment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up continuous integration, continuous deployment, and production deployment.
# Details:
Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Configure automated testing and linting on pull requests. Set up deployment to Vercel or Netlify. Implement environment-based configuration for development, staging, and production.

# Test Strategy:
Test the CI pipeline by intentionally introducing linting errors and failed tests. Verify automatic deployment by making a small change and ensuring it reflects in the staging environment. Test production build locally before deployment.
