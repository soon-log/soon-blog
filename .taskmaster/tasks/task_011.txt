# Description: Implement RSS feed generation for the blog.
# Details:
Use the feed 4.2.2 package to generate RSS XML. Create a script to build the RSS feed during the build process. Include post title, summary, publication date, and link in the feed. Ensure the feed is accessible at a fixed URL (e.g., /rss.xml).

# Test Strategy:
Validate generated RSS XML against RSS 2.0 specification. Test with various RSS readers. Ensure all recent posts are included in the feed.
