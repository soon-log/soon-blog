# Task ID: 1
# Title: 개발 환경 설정
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial project structure with Next.js, TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier.
# Details:
Initialize a new Next.js project with TypeScript support. Configure ESLint for code quality and Prettier for code formatting. Set up a strict tsconfig.json for enhanced type safety. Use the latest stable versions: Next.js 13.4.3, TypeScript 5.0.4, ESLint 8.41.0, and Prettier 2.8.8. Include recommended VS Code extensions in .vscode/extensions.json.

# Test Strategy:
Verify correct installation and configuration of all tools. Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` to ensure ESLint and Prettier are working. Check TypeScript compilation with `npm run build`.
